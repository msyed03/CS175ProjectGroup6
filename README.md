# ü¶â DuoWingo 
A fun and engaging language learning tool where your progress helps your personal duck companion grow, thrive and soar!! Players have a duck companion that evolves as they earn points and complete challenges.

The game features two mini-games:
## 1. Word Jump
Test your grammar and sentence structure by helping your duck flap from branch to branch! A sentence is shown with a missing word, and users must click the branch that contains the correct conjugation or word form. Each correct choice gets your duck closer to the treetop‚Äîmake a mistake, and your duck stays grounded!

## 2. Pronounce This Word
Sharpen your speaking skills with this pronunciation challenge! A word appears on the screen, and users must pronounce it correctly using the record button at the bottom right of the screen. Say it right, and your duck flaps to the next level!


__With each correct answer and successful pronunciation, players increase their highscore, letting their duck grow into a majestic language learning companion!__
